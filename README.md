# Instructions to run local
- Go to project folder
- type
    npm install

# Notes
It's a PROTOTYPE.
During the ordering phase, in case of errors just refresh the page.
The application was designed to be displayed into a TV, in general, a big screen.
However it's responsive too.

There is no DB so all data's are stored at runtime into some simple data structures.
Only few default values have been added.
To add more at the moment is necessary to add manually into the respective dataAccess modules.

Possible plans for the future:
- Add a working DB
- Add user signin and association with the respective choices
(will be updated)
